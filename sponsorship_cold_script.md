I love that your emails go to my spam, even yahoo knows youâ€™re ðŸš®

But to answer your request, no, I do not think we should have a conversation about that, you officially became a random
guy that I do not respect, not so many have that title honestly you should be proud of yourself!
After seeing how you treated me when I was there for you and would have given you anything, Iâ€™m not surprised anymore!

Hello Naima,

I find it quite sad that you would waste your time writing such a hateful email.

I love how you just think you know what
I've been up to. Let me make your life easy and tell you how I've been. Right after our breakup, I had found so many
upsetting things about Patrick, and decided to finally leave him out of my life. It was super difficult, especially in a
time when I was so heartbroken by the situation and should have had close friends for support. After that I had a
motorcycle accident, I was bedridden a whole week, going to events I was hosting at night just to be able to stay sane
from having to stay in bed. I also injured by back in the process, but after going through X-rays, the doctor announced
to me that I did not have scoliosis. It turns out this whole time I was suffering from muscle spasms (aggravated by my
accident) and that it does not go away on its own; however, with treatment I will finally not only completely recover
from my motorcycle injuries, but also not have to deal with the chronic pain. Honestly, if you could get yourself X-Ray,
since our symptoms are so similar, maybe you could find a treatment and finally not suffer from yours.

Honestly, I think the only reason I stopped having feelings of anxiety, sadness, suffering, and other negative emotions,
is because I got so much positive emotions from the news that my suffering would end. I was so happy that I could
finally
be free from the pain I had been suffering from for so long.

Regarding my friends, I don't need someone like you to tell me who they are. I know who I am, I know what I stand for.
I can let you imagine the most horrible things about me if it helps you deal with the fact that you got rid of someone
who genuinely loved you to the bottom of their soul.

You don't know my friends, you don't know my family, you don't know me. I'm so fortunate to have the people I have in my
life, and I'm so grateful for them. I'm so grateful for the people who have been there for me, who have reached out,
even friends who called just from seeing I looked like I had less energy in my photos.

I'm sure you feel dating people will make you feel better, but honestly I think you should take some time to heal.
You're not ready to date, you're not ready to be in a relationship. You're not ready to be with someone who will love
you, because you don't love yourself. You don't love yourself enough to have difficult conversations when something
isn't going well. You resort to being passive-aggressive, and you resort to acting like nothing is wrong.

It's such a shame that you don't see how much you hurt people. I'm sure you think you're doing the right thing, but
you're not. You're hurting people, and you're hurting yourself. You're not doing yourself any favors by being so
obsessed with the situation. I was weeks away from offering to support you through your studies, I'm glad I got to see
what you're really like before I did that.

I have some clothing and test tubes that belong to you. I don't mind giving them to a friend to exchange for the things
I still have at your place. I won't be meeting you in person as you've proven you'd only try to hurt me even more.

I hope you find the help you need, and I hope one day you find the love you deserve and that you will be open and honest
about your concerns, and that you will be able to have difficult conversations with the people you love.
